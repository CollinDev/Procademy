A website for Procademy, if you randomly stumble upon this it's a website I'm currently making. Only official changes will be put on this website, no "beta" changes or any bullcrap.

The idea for this is the website for a while collar trade school, pretty much only 1-2 years of college with a cheaper price, learning everything you can do in a normal college but quicker and better.

Made for my dad, he is doing all of the "businuess" work and I just wanna be nice so he doesn't need to hire anyone for a website lmao.

P.S. don't try to steal code or legal action will be taken.
